# Audit trail (06/11/2026). Without it, the account keeps only 90 days of event history, which
# cannot be exported after the fact. One multi-region trail of management events: the first copy
# of those is free, so the cost is the bucket's few cents. Log file validation lets a digest prove
# that no log was changed or removed.
